## Open Gov/Open Data in DNA

*Note: Original report text here: http://www.nasa.gov/open/plan/framework.html*

"NASA's founding legislation, the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, addresses the role NASA should play in ensuring the general welfare of the United States, with language directly applicable to the principles of Open Government:

Sec. 203. (a) The Administration, in order to carry out the purpose of this Act, shall—

(1) plan, direct, and conduct aeronautical and space activities;

(2) arrange for participation by the scientific community in planning scientific measurements and observations to be made through use of aeronautical and space vehicles, and conduct or arrange for the conduct of such measurements and observations;

(3) provide for the **widest practicable and appropriate dissemination of information concerning its activities and the results thereof;**

(4) seek and encourage, to the maximum extent possible, the fullest commercial use of space; and

(5) encourage and provide for Federal Government use of commercially provided space services and hardware, consistent with the requirements of the Federal Government.

— NASA Space Act (as Amended), Section 203 [emphasis added]"  [citation -- 2010 report, page…]

"NASA is a community of scientists, engineers, and other professionals who explore the Earth and space for the benefit of humankind. As we uncover increasing knowledge about the universe and solve difficult engineering challenges, we are continuously experimenting in labs, workshops, and offices. We gather and analyze information about our universe, requiring perseverance and creativity to solve unique challenges. Unlocking the complex systems of the cosmos does not come with an operating manual. Instead, we create hypotheses, conduct experiments, and refine our mental models and conceptual frameworks based on evidence and experience."  [citation -- 2010 report, page…]

"The Open Government Initiative is a movement within government to adapt to the changing external environment, embrace new technologies, engage with our citizens, and encourage collaborations and partnerships. This is the result of the government recognizing that we can be more relevant for our stakeholders and intentionally create a culture of openness as we evolve into a twenty-first century democracy."  [citation -- 2010 report, page…]

"Achieving a more open government will require the various professional disciplines within the Government-such as policy, legal, procurement, finance, and technology operations-to work together to define and to develop open government solutions." [citation -- 2010 report, page…]

NASA’s Open Government Initiative has matured, evolved, and adapted to shifting priorities in leadership from the White House, Office of Management and Budget, and NASA executives. The original tenets have not changed; however, the application of open government principles -- participation, transparency, and openness -- is an interpretation of priorities through the lens of leadership.

Over the last six years from the Open Gov Plan 1.0 to today with Open Gov Plan 4.0, NASA Chief Information Officer (CIO) has changed three times and the leadership of the Open Government initiative shifted from joint representation by the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and CIO to sole ownership by the CIO. The CFO who originally signed the first report left the agency, as well as the two of the three CIO’s. The Open Government Initiative has been shepherded by three different teams, each bringing a unique perspective to how open government should be managed and implemented. In addition, the White House leadership of the Open Government effort has changed hands and shifted priorities. Each report reflects the guidance provided to federal agencies by the White House, as well as the progress and priorities reflected by the NASA teams.

For this report, our team took a look at each of the previous reports to provide an analysis of what we said we would do, and what we actually accomplished.

## Open Gov Activities Matrix

For the Open Gov plan 4.0, NASA collected all the activities highlighted in previous reports and provided a matrix view for easy tracking by civic organizations. Over the years, activities changed names and shifted due to leadership priorities. Some continue today with little change to the function and focus, while others were completed, closed out, or merged with similar activities. The nuance between a completed and closed activity, is that leadership may determine a project is closed prior to completion due to budget constraints, personnel changes, or shifting mission priorities. Some activities grew and spun off new activities.

Each activity in the matrix designates the Plan version -- 1.0 from 2010, 2.0 from 2012, 3.0 from 2014, and the current 4.0 Plan; as well as the page number for the previous plans. The activities and initiatives found in the M-16-16 OMB guidance is marked by bold text and the section designation and page number for easy reference.

"NASA Classified National Security Information," NPR 1600.2, establishes Agency procedures for the proper implementation and management of a uniform system for classifying, accounting, safeguarding, and declassifying national security information generated by or in the possession of NASA.
Classification occurs in different flavors. Mandatory declassification occurs in response to a request for declassification that meets the requirements under section 3.5 of the Order. Automatic declassification occurs on a specific date or event as determined by the OCA or the expiration of a maximum timeframe for duration of classification established under the Order. Systematic declassification occurs upon review of classified information contained in records that have been determined by the Archivist (National Archives and Records Administration) to have permanent historical value in accordance with Title 44, U.S. Code.

NASA Officials for Privacy Related Matters
</td>
    <td>NASA places a high priority on protecting all sensitive unclassified information (SBU) created, collected, maintained and managed by or on behalf of NASA. Among the various categories of SBU, privacy information, under the various labels of information in identifiable form (IIF), personally identifiable information (PII) and information subject to the Privacy Act of 1974 (Privacy Act Record), are among the most sensitive, requiring multiple levels of protection and compliance with federal standards and laws.
Meeting these requirements ensures NASA is in compliance with all related federal laws and standards, and ensures NASA and the federal government retain the public trust. For the individuals from whom we collect privacy information (members of the public, as well as government employees), these measures protect them from embarrassment, identity theft, credit fraud or other harm. All system, application and information owners must fully comply with NASA Privacy Policy and Procedures, and all employees are required to maintain a state of awareness and training that ensures they are able to appropriately protect such information.

Continuous release, which is on-going, frequent release of software under development within well-defined bounds and periodic review (subject to NPR 2210.1.A)."

* SBIR/STTR -- Jenn Gustetic

    * Small Business Innovation Research/Small Business Technology Transfer operates in three phases:

        * Phase I: establish the scientific, technical, commercial merit, and feasibility of the proposed innovation, and the quality and performance of the small business concern (SMC).

        * Phase II: development, demonstration, and delivery of the innovation. Contracts last 24 months with a maximum funding of $750,000.

        * Phase III: commercialization of innovative technologies, products, and services resulting from Phase I or II.
